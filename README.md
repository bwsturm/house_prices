# Kaggle competition for predicting house prices
My notebook for house price predictions in Ames, IA

These notebooks show work that I have done so far on the Kaggle competition for predicting house prices in Ames, Iowa.  A description of the notebooks are as follows:

Filenames:                             
house_prices_bsturm_ver1.ipynb        

My first attempt at reading in the train.csv file and cleaning it in order to run some machine learning models.  However, I got stuck when I tried to run the models on the Test data.  So, I needed to a better strategy for parsing and cleaning the Train and Test datasets.  So, I created a new notebook and started over.

hosue_prices_bsturm_ver2.ipynb        

This is my current version of the notebook and is the one someone new to this site should examine.  I'm currently sitting at 1156/2603 on the leaderboard, which is within the top 45%.  I think I can still do much better with a bit more work.
