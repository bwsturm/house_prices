Filename:                             Info:
house_prices_bsturm_ver1.ipynb        My first attempt at reading in the train.csv file and cleaning it in order to run some  
                                      machine learning models.  However, I got stuck when I tried to run the models on the Test
                                      data.  So, I needed to a better strategy for parsing and cleaning the Train and Test
                                      datasets.  So, I created a new notebook and started over.
hosue_prices_bsturm_ver2.ipynb        This is my current attempt at predicting house prices.  I'm now ranked in the top 45% on
                                      the leaderboard.
